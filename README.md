# Three-Body Problem
## Introduction
Modeling gravitational forces and movement of 3 bodies.
It's tougher than you might think! The 3BP can't really be definitely "solved" using a set number of equations/operations (no closed-form solution). 
The best one can really do is using power series (under certain initial conditions, mainly that angular velocity = 0, meaning we have no triple collisions). However, such a solution (Sundman's) is kind of useless; we don't get meaningful estimates until about 10<sup>8000000</sup> terms!

BUT! 
We can still have fun with the 3BP with some cool very-special case solutions. One of the first ones I came across was the "figure 8 solution," which was discovered and proved around 20-30 years ago.

Funky! There's tons of other cool solutions out there, resulting in polar flowers, cardioids, circles, and weirdly chaotic figure 8's. How do we know this? Because Henri PoincarÃ© proved there's an infinte number ðŸ™ƒ

While I obviously can't find and model them *all*, I hope to model a few nifty ones!

## The Math
*Coming soon!*

Most of my "solution" models will use Verlet's solution. The gist of Verlet's is that we will estimate velocity using average acceleration. That is: $v_{t+1} = v_{t} + \dfrac{a_{t} + a_{t+1}}{2} \Delta t$

From introductory mechanics, we know the force of gravity is $|F_{g}| = \dfrac{GMm}{r^{2}}$ where:
- $G$ is the universal gravitational constant $6.67*10^{-11} [\dfrac{N*m^2}{kg^2}] $
- $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the two interacting bodies, measured in $kg$
- $r$ is the distance between the bodies, measured in $m$

But we're better than this! We'll use vectors. The force of gravity of $M$ on $m$ will be along the unit vector from $m$ to $M$. A quick Google search of unit vectors helps us see that this unit vector will be $\^{r} = \dfrac{\vec{r}}{|r|}$. So we can rewrite our initial gravity equation using vectors:
$$\vec{F_{g}} = \dfrac{GMm}{|r|^{2}} \^{r} = \dfrac{GMm}{|r|^{2}} \dfrac{\vec{r}}{|r|}$$
$$\Rightarrow \vec{F_{g}} = \dfrac{GMm}{|r|^{3}} \^{r}$$

Okay great. But what we *want* is the next position of a body (at time $t+1$). Again, from basic mechanics we know:
$$\vec{r_{t+1}} = \vec{r_{t}} + \vec{v_{t}} t + \dfrac{1}{2} \vec{a_{t}} t^{2}$$
where $t$ is the change in time between subsequent periods $t+1$ and $t$. And we can find the other values:
- $v_{t+1} = v_{t} + \dfrac{a_{t} + a_{t+1}}{2} t$ (Verlet's approximation from above!)
- $\vec{a_{t}} = \dfrac{\vec{F_{g}}}{m}$

Now we have all the equations we need, and the relationships between them. The steps we can use to find the position of a body after some time are the following:
1. Givens: mass $m$, initial position $\vec{r_{t}}$, velocity $\vec{v_{t}}$, and acceleration $\vec{a_{t}}$
2. Find distance between each body.
3. Find $F_g$ using the masses (known), $G$ (known), distances (step 2)
4. Find $a_t = \dfrac{F_g}{m}$
5. Find new position: $\vec{r_{t+1}} = \vec{r_{t}} + \vec{v_{t}} t + \dfrac{1}{2} \vec{a_{t}} t^{2}$
6. Find new acceleration (will be used to calculate new velocity): repeat steps 2-4 to get $a_{t+1}$
7. Find new velocity $v_{t+1} = v_{t} + \dfrac{a_{t} + a_{t+1}}{2} t$
8. Plot positions found in step 5
9. ðŸ˜Ž

Note that $t$ in the above equations is a change in time between periods (your timestep). This is something I've defined in the code, set as 0.02sec.

And that's it!
