# Three-Body Problem
## Introduction
Modeling gravitational forces and movement of 3 bodies.
It's tougher than you might think! The 3BP can't really be definitely "solved" using a set number of equations/operations (no closed-form solution). 
The best one can really do is using power series (under certain initial conditions, mainly that angular velocity = 0, meaning we have no triple collisions). However, such a solution (Sundman's) is kind of useless; we don't get meaningful estimates until about 10<sup>8000000</sup> terms!

BUT! 
We can still have fun with the 3BP with some cool very-special case solutions. One of the first ones I came across was the "figure 8 solution," which was discovered and proved around 20-30 years ago.

Funky! There's tons of other cool solutions out there, resulting in polar flowers, cardioids, circles, and weirdly chaotic figure 8's. How do we know this? Because Henri PoincarÃ© proved there's an infinte number ðŸ™ƒ

While I obviously can't find and model them *all*, I hope to model a few nifty ones!
